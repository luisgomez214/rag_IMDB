# Overview
On IMDb, there is a section called "Reviews" where members share their ratings and written reviews of movies and shows. Another section, titled "External Reviews," provides links to other sites with additional reviews, but only as links, without offering users any immediate insights. My goal is to enhance this experience by creating a chatbot that users can interact with based on the content of these reviews.

The LLM used for this system is Groq llama, the language model is not up to date with information from recently released movies. This system focuses on the 2024 movie 'Wicked' but can easily be used for other movies. Simply switch the links on 'test_scrape_imdb.py'.


# Setup

First scrape all the links found in the 'External Reviews' (the ones I used are 'https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1262426/externalreviews/?ref_=tt_ov_crv'). I used a software called ParseHub. 
Once all new links have been retrieved, replace the current links in 'test_scrape_imdb.py' with the new ones. 

Then run: 
```
python3 test_scrape_imdb.py 
```

# Database

Once 'test_scrape_imdb.py' has been ran, a SQL database is made. The contents of the database are
```
    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reviews (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            title TEXT,
            date TEXT,
            original_language TEXT,
            review TEXT
        )
    ''')
```
id, title, date, the original language of the text, and the review itself

Over 70% of the links were abled to be added to the database. Some are excluded due to the websites privacy restrictions or because of formatting issues.

Now, setup your GROQ API KEY:
```
export GROQ_API_KEY=
```


# Examples
**Example 1: Answer Questions Based on Summary**

The system can answer simple summazation question based on the external reviews.  

Example 1: 
```
luis@Luiss-MacBook-Pro-40 finalproj % python3 -i test3.py                                                         
movie_rag> Who are the stars of the 2024 movie Wicked?
The stars of the 2024 movie Wicked are:

1. Cynthia Erivo (Elphaba)
2. Ariana Grande (Galinda)
3. Michelle Yeoh (Madam Morrible)
4. Jeff Goldblum (Wizard)
5. Jonathan Bailey (Fiyero)
```

**Example 2: Answer Questions Based on Critics Opnions**

Beyond text summazation, the system can answer questions based on opinions. 

Example 2:
movie_rag> Did critics have a good or bad review of the 2024 movie Wicked?
Critics had a generally positive review of the 2024 movie Wicked. The feedback described it as visually stunning, musically captivating, and emotionally resonant. They praised the strong performances of the cast, particularly Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, as well as the production design, costume design, and music.```


```
movie_rag> What did critics think were some of the issues with the 2024 movie Wicked?
According to the review summaries and feedback, critics noted the following issues with the 2024 movie Wicked:

1. Pacing: The film felt slightly slow or plodding at times, with some scenes that could be trimmed or edited to maintain a consistent tempo.
2. Tone: The tone was occasionally inconsistent or uneven, with moments that didn't quite match the overall light and playful tone of the film.
3. Character Relationships: Some supporting characters in the movie felt underdeveloped, and critics recommended adding more depth or nuance to these characters to enrich the story and create a more complex narrative.
```

# Evaluate: 
To evaluate the system, both partial and semantic similarities were used. The threshold for semantic was at least .6 and for partial at least .8. If the predicted matched by either of those thresholds, then it is counted as correct. At times, "vague" or "broad" questions will give different answers than what was expected. For example "What did crtics think of Ariana Grande's performance in the 2024 movie Wicked." Will result in a different answer every time because there are many things critics could talk about regarding her performance.

Question: How does the 2024 movie Wicked differ from the Broadway musical?
Expected: While the movie remains largely faithful to the musical, it expands on the visual storytelling with more elaborate settings and cinematography. Some scenes are adjusted for the screen format, and a few new dialogues were added to enhance character depth.
Predicted: Although not explicitly stated in the provided review summaries and metadata, based on generic knowledge about the production, it can be inferred that the 2024 movie "Wicked" is a film adaptation of the iconic Broadway musical of the same name. 

Some differences between the movie and the Broadway musical "Wicked" include:

1. **Transition from Stage to Screen:** The movie "Wicked" is a filming adaptation of the stage production, meaning the format of the storytelling has changed from live performances to a cinematic experience. This shift could result in visual and narrative changes.

2. **Enhanced Visuals:** With a movie adaptation, the creative team likely had more resources at their disposal for elaborate sets, visual effects, and cinematography, which could enhance the overall visual experience.

3. **Interpretation of Musical Numbers:** The stage production has impressive musical numbers performed live by the cast and orchestra. The movie version might have made some adjustments to the song arrangements, choreography, or even potentially using post-production elements to emphasize certain aspects.

4. **Screenplay and Narrative Adjustments:** In the movie adaptation, there might be minor adjustments in the storytelling to better accommodate a two-hour cinematic format, including scenes that wouldn't have been feasible in a stage production due to time and space constraints.

5. **Extension of Emotional Resonance:** The film adaptation could delve deeper into the emotions and character development of certain characters due to a more dynamic audio-visual storytelling approach.

Please note that the differences mentioned are speculative, and since specific information about the stage production of "Wicked" isn't available in the provided data, this answer is based on commonly anticipated changes in moving a stage production to the big screen.

Question: How do critics compare the movie Wicked to other recent musical adaptations?
Expected: Critics place Wicked among the top musical adaptations, citing its ambitious production values and emotional depth as standout features compared to other recent releases.
Predicted: According to the feedback provided, critics do not explicitly compare Wicked to other recent musical adaptations. However, based on similar genre reviews from critics, recent musical adaptations with high musical or fantasy elements often have the following trends: 

1. Critiques of pacing, tone, or characterization can sometimes be too similar in musical adaptations.
2. New musical adaptations offer improved visuals and have the potential to add new ideas into a story.
3. The original concept or content can make or break an otherwise great adaptation.

With these trends in mind, assuming some musical adaptations might indeed have varying quality or common pitfalls, I will posit a guess for potential criticism of Wicked, using critical context found in reviews of similar movies: 

In comparison to other recent musical adaptations, critics might find Wicked's greatest strength to be its strong character development and world-building, similar to films such as Chicago (2002), Les Misérables (2012), or Hamilton (2020). The movie's emotional resonance and engaging storyline could make it stand out among musical adaptations, similar to projects like Mamma Mia! (2008) or The Greatest Showman (2017). However, the pacing and tone might be criticized for being inconsistent, much like in some other big-budget musical adaptations, such as Phantom of the Paradise (2023), American Buffalo (in development) etc. 

Please note that I've drawn parallels based on genre trends and the absence of direct comparisons in the feedback. Actual reviews of Wicked would provide a more accurate answer to this question.
